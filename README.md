## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the first of these projects I've completed, coming from a background studying Python. Whilst I have some experience working with Web Development, I'm aware there's lots for me to learn and completing a number of these projects should help me develop. I haven't looked at other examples yet (deliberately not wanting to be reliant on other solutions) but will be exploring how other people approached this task.


```css
#headphoneImg {
    width: 100%;
    border-top-left-radius: 20px;
    border-top-right-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I had some issues working out how to vertically align the content so becoming more comfortable with Flex (I've previously used Bootstrap for a project and wanted to approach this with a more 'vanilla' angle.

Additional research into best practice, refactoring both HTML and CSS will be beneficial before moving into integrating JS. I'd like to revisit this project in the future to add Event Listeners as well as maybe using an array for the selection of the 'plan' for the project.

### Useful resources

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46986859/how-can-i-put-elements-underneath-each-other-in-flex-display - This helped in terms of organising the internal 'Annual Plan' box - more practice would help with this.
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11483708/creating-rounded-corners-for-top-half-of-the-buttons-in-css - There were some more complex ways of achieving something that was easily remedied with the CSS 'border-top-left/right-radius' option. I'm interested to find out more about how/why you might use other JS options/

I actually hadn't heard about Frontend Mentor until it was mentioned by Coder Coder (coder-coder.com) in a Youtube video which titled 'Stop Wasting time when you're learning to code!'
